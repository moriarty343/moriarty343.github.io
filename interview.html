        <p>Morgan Moriarty talked with Ed Aschoff about what it takes to make it in the sports journalism business. Aschoff joined ESPN.com in 2011 after spending four years covering the University of Florida for The Gainesville Sun. He grew up in Oxford, Miss., before attending UF, graduating with a B.S. in journalism.  </p>
        <p><strong>You started out at the Gainesville Sun. How did you get that job, and what was it like?</strong></p>
        <p>“I was working for Rivals.com, their Florida site, during recruiting and just stories here and there about the team. So I had some clips already and I had a pretty good grasp on the Florida beat. I was pretty young, but the thing that really helped me was when I took Sports Reporting with Jason Cole. He really helped me find my voice and helped me realize what it took to be a real journalist. When I was in his class, I started covering the beat a little more and I got used to the everyday thing. </p> 
        <p>Basically he stuck his neck out there, and when The Sun was looking to expand its football coverage he said I was somebody that I should take a look at and everything. So they brought me in for an interview and I talked to them for a little bit and they started me off as a freelancer. My first couple of assignments were Q and A’s but eventually I was basically the #3 guy covering football and the #2 guy covering basketball, and I covered baseball. But it really started out with Jason Cole putting his neck out there and kind of helping me in that class really learning how to cover a beat,” said Aschoff.</p>
        <p><strong>How did The Sun turn into ESPN.com gig?</strong></p>
        <p>"At the Sun it started off with me basically asking if they wanted anything recruiting related and because of my background at Rivals they said ‘sure’. I had a bunch of kids’ numbers, I knew the game, I knew how to cover recruiting more than just a beat of covering one team. So Jeff Barlis was the online editor at the time and we created this website and it started off as a post a week and then eventually turned into a couple more posts a week, then I had a mailbag and it just kind of blossomed into an everyday thing. Eventually there was really no limitation on it because we were getting a lot of traffic and I was getting a lot of connections, the site was just doing really well. We had a web show; I was traveling around to high school games primarily for recruiting and really that helped get my name out there originally and nationally. Then I started doing the SEC page for the newspaper every Thursday and that was basically just Q and A’s with a player, five things to watch, five numbers to learn, and then what was going on in the SEC. That’s what really drew attention from Chris Low, who was already on the [ESPN.com] SEC Blog. So when ESPN was looking to expand its coverage of the SEC so he put in a good word for me, and they started reading some of my stuff and apparently it was good enough, obviously they liked it. They gave me a call, I did a couple phone interviews and then they flew me up to Bristol one spring and went through another rigorous interview process called the Car Wash. Basically it was I think 7 interviews in 5 hours," said Aschoff. </p>
        <p><strong>How did your UF education help? Or is your success based on how you write?</strong></p>
        <p>"I think it’s a little bit of both, because I learned a lot at UF. The classes that helped me with both writing and reporting was Sports Reporting with Jason Cole and any class that I took with Mike Foley. He was really good at learning how to find your voice and tell stories where Jason, he knew that as well, but he hit reporting and journalism and breaking stories. Those are the two biggest influences on my life as a journalist at UF. And they still really are. I learned a lot at UF but I also learned on the fly especially being young and being able to cover a beat like that you certainly learn a lot without having to go through class necessarily," said Aschoff. </p>
        <p><strong>What is a typical week like during football season?</strong></p>
        <p>"It’s a lot different this year. The first couple years Chris and I were the only ones doing the SEC blog and we would during the season produced probably on average five pieces of work a day each week. Whether that’s like one big feature and four kind of newsy reaction pieces or polls or whatever that’s what we would do on a daily basis during the season every year. One Fridays we would travel to games almost every weekend. Game weekends you’re there, you’re writing a column off of it. Sunday you do kind of the day after of what we learned, and helmet stickers. Then Sunday nights during BCS Standings when they’re released we’d do reactions to that and kind of look forward and add to the bowl projections that we do every week. Now Chris and I do more pig picture stories. We don’t do as much day to day maintenance of smaller reaction pieces because we have five other guys now helping. Basically now Chris and I will write one or two things every day, if that. Sometimes we don’t write as much because we’re working on bigger pieces and talking to other people. There’s more time for interviews and stuff like that, but we still travel the same amount. We do a lot of multimedia stuff, a lot of videos; we do chats a lot, so we’re jacks of all trades pretty much," said Aschoff.</p>
        <p><strong>What’s the best advice you’d give young people who want to succeed in the industry?</strong></p>
        <p>“Break news and don’t worry so much about making everything so pretty and elegant and long and fun. Break news and make sure people notice who you are because everybody wants to write that amazing, long feature that gets somebody crying. But at the end of the day if you want to get noticed you have to break news. I broke some recruiting stories here and there, I broke some transfer stories here and there while I was at the Sun, and that’s really what helps you out  a lot. Certainly covering recruiting is definitely what helped me, but I would just say develop contacts, develop sources, and break news that’s really the biggest thing that sets people apart," said Aschoff.</p>
